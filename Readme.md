# Transferable Augmented Instruction Graph

Transferable Augmented Instruction Graph (TAIG) is a library that allows the creation of tasks plans for robots or other agent-systems that can be used across systms very easily.

Tasks are created in a graph form with conditionals and loops.  Nodes in the graph refer to "primitives" which are atomic units of work (actions for the system to perform) or conditions to test.

Create an Instruction Graph, and associate it with a Primitive Library and Memory Object (noted below) and you can execute the task on a system.

This paradigm is useful because it allows executing a single task plan across multiple robots/systems.  For a single robot, allows defining atmoic functionality once, and re-using it across all the tasks that that robot is to complete.

# Installation

To install the library just run

    pip install instruction_graph

instruction_graph has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.6.

# Introduction

There are three components to the paradigm:
1. The Memory Object
1. The Primitive Library
1. The Instruction Graph

The Memory Object has fields that store any information required by the application at runtime (session info, database connection, ROS topics, state information, and any other data the application will track and store).

The Primitive Library is an object which holds a collection of Primitives.   A Primitive can be either an Action or a Condition.  Actions a simple actions that are performed.  Conditions are simple conditions that are tested, and can be used in an IF or WHILE node.  Each Primitive has at least a Primitive ID and a function. (See more details below.)

The Instruction Graph is a directed graph.  Each node contains a reference to a primitive.  When the graph is traversed, the function held by the Primitive to which the node refers is executed. (See more details below.)

The Memory Object provides the memory, and should contain no task logic.  The Primitive Library contains Primitives with atomic functionality.  Primitives should be divided into robot/system-specific Primitives and task-specific Primitives (this organizational division is not required, but is just for your own benefit).  Primitives should not have any task logic nor should they refer to system memory directly, but rather use the Memory Object to read/write any data they require.  Primitives should be stateless.   The Instruction Graph contains the task logic.

These three components are modular.  You can switch one out without touching the other two.

During graph creation or execution, we say that a graph is "associated" with a Primitive Library and Memory Object.  This association is performed by Manager.py.

## QuickStart / Example

To just quickly run an instruction graph, you can use the example Memory and Library that ships with instruction_graph.

You can run and execute the following code:

```python
from instruction_graph import Manager
from instruction_graph import DefaultMemory, ExamplePrimitiveLibrary

COUNT = "count"
HOW_COOL = "how cool is TAIG?"

A_SET = "fun_set"
A_GET = "fun_get"
A_PRINT = "print_args"
C_LESS = "less"

mem = DefaultMemory()
lib = ExamplePrimitiveLibrary()
m = Manager(memory=mem, library=lib)

m.create_new_ig()
m.ig.add_action(A_SET, args=[COUNT,5])
m.ig.add_action(A_SET, args=[HOW_COOL,"So awesome and cool."])

m.ig.add_if(C_LESS, args=[COUNT, 10])
m.ig.add_action(A_PRINT, args=["The count is less than 10", None])
m.ig.add_else()
m.ig.add_action(A_PRINT, args=["The count is NOT less than 10", None])
m.ig.add_end_if()

m.ig.add_action(A_SET, args=[HOW_COOL])
m.save_ig("graph.ig")

m.load_ig()
m.run()
```

You are creating a graph using the example Memory and Primitive Library.  It will set two values in the memory, check one of them in an if condition and print, and then get the value of the other and print it.

This is a basic example, of course, so that you can understand it easily.

## Details for developing on your own TAIG

Memory, Primitives, and Graph are decoupled and modular.  You can use different Memory Objects with the same or different Graphs, and different Primitive Libraries with the same or different Graphs.   So, you can create them and combine them in any order.

### Creating Memory

Memory is a good place to start as you create your own system.  Technically Memory is not required.  If your application is totally reactive and stateless, then you can just set the memory to None in the Manager.

Probably you will want some memory though.

When creating the memory object, consider all the types of information that you may want to store.  This could be containers for application state information, connections to databases, or anything else you will need.


Consider this class, similar to DefaultMemory in the QuickStart example:
```python
from instruction_graph.components.Memory import BaseMemory


class DefaultMemory2(BaseMemory):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DefaultMemory2, self).__init__()
        self.vars = {}
        self.database_connection
        self.counter = 0
        self.whatever = "data"

    def memory_name(self):
        return "Another_Example_Memory"
 ```
It has attributes that an application can use. A Memory object can define any attributes.

Memory Object should extend BaseMemory, and implement the `memory_name` method.

If you want your application to publish to a ROS topic, we recommend adding the rospy.Publisher object as a value to an attribute of the Memory object.   If you want your application to subscribe to a ROS topic, we recommend adding that to the Memory as well, along with any callback (the callback could update additional values in the memory).  Primitives should not subscribe to topics directly, and Primitives should publish to ROS topics by referencing the Publisher on the Memory object.

### Creating Primitives

Primitives are where the actual low-level functionality for executing task components is stored.

There are two kinds of Primitives, Actions and Conditions.   Actions store atomic functionality, and are meant to be used on Action nodes.  Conditions check conditions, and are meant to be used on IF or WHILE nodes.

Primitive functions can be parameterized (they can take arguments).

To create a primtiive, you will first define a function.  A function meant for an action primitive should not have a return value.  A function meant for a condition primtive should return `True` or `False`.

See an example Primitive Library defined below.

```python
from instruction_graph.components.PrimitiveLibrary import BasePrimitiveLibrary
from instruction_graph.components.PrimitiveTuples import ActionPrimitive as Action, ConditionalPrimitive as Cond


class ExamplePrimitiveLibrary2(BasePrimitiveLibrary):
    def library_name(self):
        return "Example_Primitive_Library_2"

    def list_action_primitives(self):
        return [
            Action(fn_name='set', fn=self.set_value, human_name='Set Function', human_description='Sets a value in the memory.'),
            Action("print_args", self.print_args, "Print with Args", "Print the first argument interpolated with the second.")
            Action("dec", self.decrement, "Decrement Key", "Decrement the value found at the specified key by 1")
        ]

    def list_conditional_primitives(self):
        return [
            Cond('less', self.check_if_less, human_name='is less', human_description="Checks if the value of a certain key is less than a given value. (Returns true if so.)")
        ]

    # Actions #

    @staticmethod
    def print_args(memory, text, args):
        print(text % args)

    @staticmethod
    def set_value(memory, key, value):
        memory.info[key] = value
        print('%s set to %s' % (key, value))

    @staticmethod
    def decrement(memory, key):
        value = memory.info[key] - 1
        memory.info[key] = value
        print("%s: %s (decremented)" % (key, value))

    # Conditions #

    @staticmethod
    def check_if_less(memory, key, maximum):
        value = int(memory.info[key])
        return value < maximum
```

Note how functions are defined and then referenced in the ActionPrimitive and ConditionPrimitive instantiations.

Required methods are:
* library_name - a string to indicate this library's name, used in logging
* list_action_primitives - should return a list of ActionPrimitives
* list_conditional_primitives - should return a list of ConditionalPrimitives

### Creating the Graph and Saving to File

Let's use our Memory and PrimitiveLibrary from above in creating an instruction graph.

We instantiate a Manager object, specifying the Memory and PrimitiveLibrary objects that we created above.

This particular graph will set the value of "count" in the memory to 6.

Then it will kick off a loop that will run until "count" is less than 1.  In each iteration of the loop it will check if "count" is less than 3.  If so, it will print "count is less than 3" and if not it will print "count is greater than or equal to 3".  Then "count" will be decremented.

Finally, the graph will be saved to "graph_filename.ig"

```python
from instruction_graph import Manager

mem_obj = DefaultMemory2()
eg_library = ExamplePrimitiveLibrary2()
igm = Manager(library=eg_library, memory=mem_obj)
ct = "count"
igm.create_new_ig()
igm.ig.add_action("set", args=[ct, 6])
igm.ig.add_loop('less', args=[ct, 1], negation=True)

igm.ig.add_if('less', args=[ct, 3])
igm.ig.add_action("print_args", args=["count is less than %d", 3])
igm.ig.add_else()
igm.ig.add_action("print_args", args=["count is greater than or equal to %d", 3])
igm.ig.add_end_if()

igm.ig.add_action("dec", args=[ct])
igm.ig.add_end_loop()
igm.save_ig("graph_filename.ig")
```

Run this code to check it out!

### Running the Graph

After you have created "graph_filename.ig," you can load it and run it.

Use the following code to do so (you can reuse the existing Manager or create a new one as show).
```python
from instruction_graph import Manager

mem_obj = DefaultMemory2()
eg_library = ExamplePrimitiveLibrary2()
igm = Manager(library=eg_library, memory=mem_obj)

igm.load_ig("graph_filename.ig")
igm.run()
```

Note that the graph can be run on a system right from the file.  You do not need to create anew.  Make sure that the Primitive Library and Memory Object you use with a graph are compatible.
